# DEEP_York

The first part of the module will develop your understanding of the fundamental principles in statistics underlying machine learning tools, such as regressors and classifiers. The second part of the module introduces ideas about using neural network architectures to implement so-called deep learning approaches.

## Module Aims

This module builds on the basic machine learning covered in earlier modules (**INT2**, **IMLO**) and takes students up to state-of-the-art methods in modern deep learning.

* **Probabilistic & Deep Learning Methods:** Introduces probabilistic methods to reason about uncertainty, and deep learning methods where multi-layered neural networks serve as powerful general models.
* **Techniques Covered:** Explores a range of methods and architectures for classification and regression problems, unsupervised generative models, and their underlying mathematics.
* **Practical Implementation:** Covers both theory and practicalities, including how these ideas are implemented in modern machine learning libraries like **PyTorch**.


## How We Teach This Module

In this module, we use a hybrid between a traditional lecture-based module and the "flipped classroom" approach:

* **Face-to-Face Lectures (Start of the week):** Focuses on introducing topics, motivation, inspiring examples, and interesting related ideas. These are designed to be thought-provoking yet easy to follow.
* **Short Video Lectures (Independent study):** The core technical content is broken down into short, focused videos. This allows you to rewatch complex concepts multiple times at your own pace.
* **Practical Sessions (Later in the week):** A two-hour session to practically try out concepts. You can work collaboratively and ask questions to the lecturers, GTAs, and fellow students.
* **Live Q&A Session (End of the week):** A gathering to answer live or pre-submitted questions, and to explore interesting issues that arose during practicals.
* **Office Hours:** A private setting with the week's lecturer to ask individual questions or get help if you are stuck.


## How to Ask Questions

Questions from students are absolutely key to the module running well. **No question is stupid!** We don't know what you don't know, and answering your questions helps everyone.

Here are the ways you can ask questions:

* **VLE Discussion Board (Preferred):** Everyone benefits from the Q&A. We will write a response here and may also discuss it in the live session.
* **Live Q&A Session:** The most fun and interactive way to ask a question, especially for group discussions.
* **Email the Lecturers:** For individual questions. If the answer is of broad value, we will post it anonymously on the VLE.
* **Practical Sessions:** The best place for specific code help or getting "unstuck", as well as broader conceptual questions.

> **💡 Note on Speculative Questions & Observations:** > It doesn't have to be a question! Observations like *"If X is the case then Y must also be true"* are highly encouraged. Speculative questions (e.g., *"Could you use X for Y?"*) help everyone see links between ideas. If your assumption is incorrect, our explanation will help clarify why.


## Module Learning Outcomes (M Level)

Upon successful completion of this module, you will be able to:

* **Apply** the probabilistic basis of machine learning to problems.
* **Demonstrate** a working knowledge of manifold embedding and kernel methods.
* **Apply** a range of Bayesian methods for classification and clustering.
* **Be familiar** with the main deep learning architectures.
* **Use** the optimisation process and apply different variants (e.g., gradient descent, stochastic algorithms, ADAM).
* **Work** on systems that handle larger amounts of training data and be able to discuss the problems and solutions.
